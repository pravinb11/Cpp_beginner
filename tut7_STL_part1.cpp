/*
What is the STL?
* A library of powerful, reusable, adaptable, generic classes and functions
* Implemented using C++ templates
* Implements common data structres and algorithms
* Huge class library!!
* Developed by Alexander Stepanov (1994)

* Assortment of commonly used containers
* Known time and size complexity
* Tried and tested - Reusability!!
* Consistent, fast, and type-safe
* Extensible

    * Collections of objects or primitive types 
      (array, vector, deque, stack, set, map, etc.)
